				<h3> After All, the Earth Must Wait for Spring</h3>
				<p> <i>After all, the Earth must wait for spring.
				No angel ever changed the pace of time.
				Goodness is still tucked away below,
				Empty as a field asleep in snow,
				Like iron in the harshness of that clime
				As God is born in frozen Bethlehem.</i></p>

				<h3> Candles Are a Gift of Light</h3>
				<p> <i>Candles are a gift of light,
				A tiny sun, a bit of star.
				No other dancer in the night
				Dances with such sheer delight,
				Little souls serene and bright,
				Each a glimpse of what we are
				Shining innocent and pure.</i></p>
